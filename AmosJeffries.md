Email: squid3 (AT) treenet (DOT) co (DOT) nz

I joined the Squid development community in January 2007 intending to
just complete a then-partial
[IPv6](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/AmosJeffries/Features/IPv6#)
feature branch and was promoted to the Core Developer team mid-May of
that year. Being the sucker that I am, I also tripped my way into the
position of release maintainer for Squid-3 early in 2008, then kicked
off the [Translation
Project](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/AmosJeffries/Translations#)
a few months later.

I run an IT Consulting business [](http://www.treenet.co.nz); Treehouse
Networks Ltd. in New Zealand. Which provides customers from around the
world with a web hosting, email and content delivery network (CDN) built
with Squid.

A few bits and pieces about Squid including
[PayPal](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/AmosJeffries/PayPal#)
