# QA Pilots

The Squid Project needs to reduce the number of regression bugs in Squid
releases and development snapshots. The large number of regressions
illustrate that our peer code reviews are naturally insufficient, and
our post-commit build tests are woefully inadequate.

To partially address these systemic problems, the Squid Software
Foundation plans to adjust the commit process (making successful
regression testing mandatory before any commit) and to hire a paid
DevOps/QA engineer to back that new process with the necessary
infrastructure support. We already have a set of proxy testing tools,
but the existing Project volunteers do not have enough time, interest,
and/or skills to use/improve those tools and support the QA
infrastructure. A paid engineer would be able to focus on that.

Before a regular QA Engineer position is filled, we offer the following
pilot projects. These pilots will help the Project to select the most
suitable candidate. They also provide a good illustration of the kind of
challenges a Project QA Engineer will face.

Application ~~is~~was open to anybody interested in doing the pilots and
continuing working with the Squid Project afterwards. The Project ads
were viewed by thousands of people. We received about 50 resumes and 10
completed applications. We selected one engineer to do the first Pilot
(at least). It is our intention to complete all these pilot projects and
then fill the QA Engineer position.

Please see the [Q\&A](#Q_and_A) section for more info.

## Application

![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
Applications are now closed. You may submit yours as a backup in case
the first Pilot projects fail, but please note that your application
will receive very little attention until that failure (and we hope the
pilots will succeed\!).

## Pilot-1

|                |                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal:          | Protect Squid trunk from build failures                     |
| Duration:      | 4 weeks                                                     |
| Cost:          | $1'000                                                      |
| Preconditions: | Project invitation based on the [Application](#Application) |

Currently, all accepted Squid code changes are first committed to Squid
bzr repository. Jenkins notices a new commit and performs several build
tests. If a build test fails, an email is sent to the squid-dev mailing
list with the failure details. Humans usually notice the email report
and fix the problem, but that may take a few days or even weeks.
Meanwhile, the broken commit remains in Squid trunk, often blocking
other work or tempting folks to commit untested code.

We would like to rearrange this scheme so that all accepted Squid code
changes are queued *before* they are committed, and the build tests are
performed against the queued rather than committed changes. If a change
passes the build test, it is automatically committed. If a change fails
the build test, it is removed from the queue. A change removal may have
a cascading effect on other queued changes, of course, but that ought to
be rare and is acceptable.

You may propose to migrate Squid from bzr to git and/or from Jenkins to
another CI system. However, since any migration is a pain, you would
need to convince the Project that the migration is worth it *and*
provide the Project with enough information to make an informed decision
(without forcing decision makers to study the alternatives themselves).
Your proposal may require Pilot-1 duration and cost adjustments.
However, proposals requiring significant cost increases are unlikely to
be accepted.

Some build tests may use unreliable machines or experimental
configurations. There should be a way to exclude them from disqualifying
pending changes. They should still run and report failures but those
failures should have no effect on automated commits.

It should still be possible to commit changes without going though the
build validation process, but that functionality will be used in
emergencies or similar extraordinary situations only. Even seemingly
trivial changes are expected to go through the validation process.

Normally, accepted changes will be queued in FIFO order. However, it
would be nice if core developers could reorder queued changes when
necessary. That functionality is *not* required for Pilot-1 though.

Supporting a similar system for multiple Squid branches (trunk, v4.0,
v3.5, etc.) is a plus but not a hard requirement for Pilot-1 which
focuses on trunk.

Eventually, the same validate-before-commit principle will apply to
other admission and testing activities, including:

1.  developer voting during review of the proposed changes (to
    officially accept the proposed change)

2.  code formatting changes (or perhaps that would be done automatically
    to queued changes?)

3.  compliance tests (using Co-Advisor test cases)

4.  performance tests (using Web Polygraph workloads)

5.  code quality tests (using Coverity test cases)

6.  black-box functionality tests (using Daft test cases)

Keeping these plans in mind is important for Pilot-1 (to avoid proposing
an architecture that cannot accommodate those plans well), but
implementing the corresponding features is *outside* Pilot-1 scope.

## Pilot-2

|                |                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal:          | Protect Squid trunk from HTTP compliance regressions |
| Duration:      | 4 weeks                                              |
| Cost:          | $800                                                 |
| Preconditions: | Successful Pilot-1 completion and Project invitation |

Currently, there is no automated, regular Squid testing for protocol
compliance regressions or violations. Occasionally, developers run
Co-Advisor tests and fix regression bugs. At some point, automated
Co-Advisor testing was setup but it was poorly integrated and got
neglected/abandoned.

This Pilot project enables automated Co-Advisor tests for pending Squid
changes. Any worsening of a stable test case outcome (e.g., from
"success" to "violation" or "failure") would disqualify the queued code
change with a corresponding report emailed to squid-dev (and logged). An
improvement of stable test case outcomes (e.g., from "violation" to
"success") without any regressions in other test cases should
automatically update the "golden result" that is used for regressions
detection so that future changes have a higher bar to pass; a
notification about the update should be emailed to squid-dev (and
logged).

Co-Advisor comes with scripts to repeat tests and compare test results.
Integrating those scripts with the CI infrastructure to satisfy the
above requirements is the focus of Pilot-2. Cooperation with Measurement
Factory engineers may be required for smooth integration. Learning how
to configure and run Co-Advisor tests will be required, but it is not
difficult and Measurement Factory can help with that.

It should be possible for core developers to ignore a given Co-Advisor
test result so that the automated commit may proceed. This functionality
would be useful if manual checks confirm that the alleged compliance
regression was not Squid fault (or is actually desirable for some other
reason).

## Pilot-3

|                |                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal:          | Protect Squid trunk from performance regressions     |
| Duration:      | 6 weeks                                              |
| Cost:          | $1'200                                               |
| Preconditions: | Successful Pilot-2 completion and Project invitation |

Currently, there is no automated, regular Squid testing for performance
regressions which may go unnoticed for years. At some point, automated
Web Polygraph testing was setup but it was not comprehensive enough and
got neglected/abandoned. This Pilot project enables automated Polygraph
tests for pending Squid changes. A performance regression detected by
one of the tests would disqualify the queued code change with a
corresponding report emailed to squid-dev (and logged). A significant
performance improvement (without any regressions) should automatically
update the "golden result" that is used for regressions detection so
that future changes have a higher bar to pass; a notification about the
update should be emailed to squid-dev (and logged).

Measurement Factory will provide the initial set of 3-5 Polygraph
workloads for these tests. You will be responsible for scripting test
execution and result analysis, although some existing scripts can be
reused. You will need to find a way to execute performance-sensitive
tests in a CI environment to minimize false alarms. Learning how to
configure and run Web Polygraph tests will be required.

## Q and A

1.  What if I have questions not answered here?
    
      - You may post your questions to `<info@squid-cache.org>`.
        However, most of the information required to successfully apply,
        plan, and complete Pilot-1 is publicly available. We hate
        discouraging questions (and some cooperation/discussion with the
        Project *will* be required during all pilots), but please keep
        in mind that nobody has the time for detailed answers,
        especially answers to unnecessary questions. Do your best to
        solve the problems on your own and, if you have to ask
        something, make it easy for others to answer your questions.
        During the application stage, we may update this page with more
        answers to popular questions.

2.  Can you detail the expected QA Engineer position?
    
      - Just like the pilots, the QA Engineer position is for a
        part-time "remote" independent contractor. The engineer
        responsibilities will include:
        
          - Perform needs analysis and advise the Squid Project on
            available infrastructure tools and approaches for automating
            the regression testing process. Suggest specific
            alternatives and drive public discussions to arrive at the
            best solution for the Project. The candidate solutions may
            range from home-grown Jenkins scripts to commercial CI
            platforms (available to open source projects).
        
          - Automate and manage Squid regression testing. Integrate the
            existing proxy performance and functionality testing tools
            (including test-builds.sh, Coverity, Co-Advisor, Web
            Polygraph, and Daft) with the Project-designed
            infrastructure.
        
          - Learning HTTP and other Squid-related protocols with the
            goal of being eventually able to audit automated test
            results without deferring to Squid developers.
        
          - Long-term: Learning existing testing tools with the goal of
            being eventually able to create new test cases and fix old
            ones without deferring to tools developers.
        
        QA Engineer position prerequisites/requirements include:
        
        1.  Experience with open source projects, especially those that
            have many contributors. Ability to independently drive a
            project forward in the presence of multiple decision makers
            with conflicting and/or missing requirements is a big plus.
        
        2.  Ability to clearly express oneself in English, especially
            when using plain text emails and simple markup pages.
            Ability to quickly comprehend technical English literature.
            Ability to speak English is not required, but is a plus.
        
        3.  Experience with modern test automation approaches and
            platforms.
        
        4.  Excellent scripting skills. System administration skills are
            a plus.
        
        5.  10+ hours/week availability. Full-time engagement might
            eventually be possible.
        
        6.  Squid experience is a plus. C++ and/or Javascript knowledge
            is a plus. This is not a development position, but auditing
            Squid failures and writing/fixing test cases require
            development skills.

3.  May I propose non-free and/or closed-source solutions?
    
      - Yes, you may. With all other factors being equal, the Project
        would prefer a free open-source solution. The Squid Foundation
        does not currently have enough funds to spend more than
        \~$100/month on infrastructure payments and currently spends
        zero. Many commercial services do offer free (as in beer) access
        to open-source projects but it is your responsibility to
        carefully research the limits of such offerings because they may
        not include great features advertised as otherwise available.

4.  What are the payment terms and procedure?
    
      - All prices are listed in US Dollars. The Project can pay via US
        bank checks, PayPal, or bank wire transfer (subject to various
        US banking regulations). The payment will be made within 30
        calendar days of the successful pilot completion. Contractors in
        the US will need to fill out W-9s and will receive 1099s as
        required by law.

5.  Will Pilot specifications change?
    
      - Yes, Pilot specs are likely to be adjusted until the Pilot is
        awarded to a contractor. After that, any material changes would
        be negotiated with the person doing the work, of course.

6.  Will applicants be notified when this page changes?
    
      - No manual notifications are planned. Registered wiki users may
        [subscribe](/HelpOnSubscribing#)
        to monitor this page changes. It is applicants responsibility to
        stay up to date, and we encourage you to use appropriate tools
        to track this page modifications.

7.  Who determines whether a pilot was successful?
    
      - The Project will determine whether a pilot was successful. If
        there is no consensus on squid-dev, the Squid Software
        Foundation board will make that decision.

8.  I emailed my application. Now what?
    
      - You should receive an automated response that your email was
        sent to the mailing list moderator. No later than a week after
        the application deadline, you will receive a confirmation that
        your application has been received and is being reviewed. No
        later than three weeks after the application deadline, you will
        receive another email with the Project decision. If you do not
        hear from us within these periods, please do send another email
        to troubleshoot. However, sending re-confirmation emails earlier
        than necessary may decrease your acceptance chances.

9.  How can I recommend somebody else to do the pilots?
    
      - Please show them this page and encourage them to apply\!
        Unfortunately, we may not have enough time to review
        recommendations and then solicit applications from the
        recommended folks. It is best if they apply themselves.

10. Wait a second\! Is not this a DevOps position? Why do you call this
    work QA?\!
    
      - The three pilot projects and the expected initial work is indeed
        90% DevOps (if you want to use a fresh buzzword) or system
        administration (if you want to stretch an old term to cover
        things like CI on some cloud platform). We need an engineer to
        setup, configure, and occasionally create
        systems/processes/tools that guard Squid from regressions.
        Whether that engineer has "DevOps", "sysadmin", and/or "QA"
        keywords on the resume is largely irrelevant.
    
      - For example, Pilot-1 is not about writing or running QA test
        cases; it is about selecting and then setting up/integrating
        existing development and testing tools to prevent build
        failures. Similarly, Pilot-2 and Pilot-3 are not about writing
        or running test cases either\!
    
      - The long-term expectations for the position is a slow migration
        towards 75% QA because the systems/processes established in the
        beginning ought to continue to function increasingly well, with
        little ongoing maintenance. Thus, the need for DevOps/sysadmin
        work will diminish (but not disappear). On the other hand, it is
        also possible that the Squid Project will need both a DevOps and
        a QA engineer at that time. However, even at that distant stage,
        we do *not* expect the position to focus on "boring QA" tasks
        such as testing whether clicking a GUI button 100 times breaks
        something. The focus would be on triaging complex test failures
        and possibly scripting new test cases for complex
        protocols/features (both activities require serious
        understanding of network protocols, which we cannot expect the
        candidates for this position to poses, but which they may be
        able to acquire with time).
    
      - Our immediate needs are clear. Our predictions regarding the
        long-term future position requirements may be wrong. We do not
        know whether we can find a single person that can grow/adjust to
        stay in sync with the changing position requirements, but that
        would be ideal.
    
      - Besides, DevOps is a part of QA if you believe
        [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps#/media/File:Devops.svg)
        ;-).
