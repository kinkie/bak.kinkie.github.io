# Feature: ACL type "Random"

  - **Goal**: Implement an ACL type which would match randomly with a
    given probability.

  - **Status**: complete

  - **Version**: 3.2

# Details

The ACL of type "random" will accept a single value in one of three
formats:

  - A:B - matching randomly an average A requests for every B
    non-matches. A and B may not be zero.

  - A/B - matching randomly an average of A requests out of total B
    requests. A and B may not be zero.

  - 0.NNNN - matching randomly any given request with 0.NNNN
    probability.
    
      - Range is between zero to one, excluding zero and one themselves.

All three of these matches are proportional. The first two formats are
provided for ease of configuration. They are converted to a decimal
threshold as shown in the third format.

Every test, a new random number is generated and checked against the
stored value. If the random number is within the threshold range of
possibility the ACL will match.

# Use Cases

## Uplink Load Balancing

When used within
[tcp\_outgoing\_address](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/tcp_outgoing_address#)
or
[tcp\_outgoing\_tos](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/tcp_outgoing_tos#)
selection this ACL permits load to be roughly split between multiple
links based on their relative capacity.

This requires some additional configuration at the operating system
level to ensure that the address or TOS values assigned are routed out
the appropriate uplink. It is no use doing this in Squid if all traffic
ends up going out the default anyway.

  - **Example 1:** Split two uplinks roughly 50% of traffic each:

<!-- end list -->

    acl fiftyPercent random 0.5
    
    # a random 50% go here
    tcp_outgoing_address 192.0.2.1 fiftyPercent
    
    # the rest go here
    tcp_outgoing_address 192.0.2.2
    
    # NP: operating system required to route packets from 192.0.2.1 and 192.0.2.2 out separate uplinks.

  - **Example 2:** Split traffic one third to each of three peers.

<!-- end list -->

    acl third random 1/3
    acl half random 1/2
    
    # 33% traffic goes here
    cache_peer_access peerOne allow third
    cache_peer_access peerOne deny all
    
    # 33% traffic goes here
    cache_peer_access peerTwo allow half
    cache_peer_access peerTwo deny all
    
    # remaining traffic goes here
    cache_peer_access peerOne allow all

  - **Example 3:** Split traffic one third to each of two peers and
    direct.

<!-- end list -->

    acl third random 1/3
    acl half random 1/2
    
    # 33% traffic goes direct
    always_direct allow third
    
    # 33% traffic goes here (half of what did not go direct already)
    cache_peer_access peerOne deny half
    cache_peer_access peerOne allow all
    
    # remaining traffic goes here
    cache_peer_access peerTwo allow all
    
    # NP: if both peers are down DIRECT will be used as a backup.

## Log sampling of traffic

When used in
[access\_log](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/access_log#)
directives this ACL permits a small random proportion of requests to be
logged. Rather than all traffic or some only matching fixed criteria.

  - **Example 1:** Log one line randomly out of every 100 requests.

<!-- end list -->

    # log 1, skip 99
    acl logSmallSample random 1:99
    
    # small log 1 of every 100 requests...
    access_log /var/log/squid/access-sample.log squid logSmallSample
    
    # old style complete log
    access_log /var/log/squid/access.log squid

## Others?

Other use cases may be possible. If you know of one not already covered
here we are interested to know what it is.
