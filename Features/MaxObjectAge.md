# Details

Allowing administrators to set some local maximum age to store objects
seems reasonable. Whether this is some global (easily done) or ACL
controlled setting is yet to be decided.

Presently the only options are to not cache at all (cache deny), or to
extend short caching times (refresh\_pattern).

refresh\_pattern does not meet this need in its present form since it
acts as an extender, opposite to what is needed; a shortener. Adjusting
that directive may be an option though. Such shortener mode for Squid
would allow the override-\* to be used (requires them implicitly)
without violating HTTP specs. Since they retain the website limits as
*upper* bounds and any cache may freely drop an item before its maximum
storage interval.
