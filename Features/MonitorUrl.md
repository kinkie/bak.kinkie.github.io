# Details

The monitorurl feature is very handy for reverse proxies acting as load
balancers in front of farms to detect origin server failures. It's
available in 2.X but not yet in 3.X.

Furthermore, a dampening function should be implemented, to specify the
check interval, the number of failed probes before the peer is
considered down, and the number of successful probes before it's
considered back up.
