# Details

Squid can receive limited directives via Unix signals (e.g. used for
reconfigure, rotate, etc.), or via cachemgr actions (shutdown,
toggle\_offline). It would be nice to have an extendible interface to
allow finer control over a greater set of squid's behaviour.

The control channel can be used to implement all the currently-available
control knobs, plus some others, e.g. to toggle re-reading accessory
configuration files (e.g. resolv.conf, /etc/hosts and similar). This
channel should be both machine-controllable and user-controllable,
remote and allow for fine-grained permission tuning. Maybe it can be
hooked to the HTTP-ification of the cachemgr.
