## Optimize the easy parts

Get rid of some unneeded duplicate copying of information

  - There's a copy from the http.c server-side code (via storeAppend())
    to the client\_side.c client-side code (via storeClientCopy()) - in
    progress in s27\_adri branch.

  - There's a copy out from the store memory into the client-side layer
    (via storeClientCopy()) - integrated into Squid-2.HEAD

## Optimise the hard parts

  - The data copying involved in parsing http headers, URLs, and such
    from requests and replies - in progress in s27\_adri branch.

## Implement scatter-gather IO

Avoid having to use the packer to pack HTTP request/reply and headers
into a buffer before write()ing to the network-side; this won't really
be worth it until the copies are eliminated (above) and the [stackable
IO
model](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Features/Optimizations/Features/StackableIO#)
is in.

Use readv() to read into partially-filled large buffers - the goal is to
use larger buffers in the store memory if applicable to hold an entire
object in on memory allocation.
