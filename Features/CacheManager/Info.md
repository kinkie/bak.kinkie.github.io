# info report

The mgr:info report provides a high-level summary of Squid state,
including the following information:

|                          |           |                                                                                                                                 |                                     |

| CPU Usage                | %         | CPU Time / UP Time. In other words, the portion of UP Time spent using CPU.                                                     | meaningless sum of kid values (bug) |
| CPU Usage, 5 minute avg  | %         | The portion of the last 5-minute interval spent using CPU.                                                                      | meaningless sum of kid values (bug) |
| CPU Usage, 60 minute avg | %         | The portion of the last 60-minute interval spent using CPU.                                                                     | meaningless sum of kid values (bug) |

Interval-based stats are probably reported for the current (incomplete)
interval if Squid has not been running long enough to report full
interval stats.
