# vm\_objects Report

VM Objects are the objects which are in Virtual Memory. These are
objects which are currently being retrieved and those which were kept in
memory for fast access (accelerator mode).

This may also include objects which are stored in the RAM cache
([cache\_mem](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_mem#)) with no
disk copy.

    This is usually much smaller report than the full
    [objects](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Features/CacheManager/VmObjects/Features/CacheManager/Objects#)
    report. But can still be very, very large.
