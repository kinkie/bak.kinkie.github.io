# menu report

This is an index of all the actions which can be performed by this
Squid.

This report is the only reliable indication of what reports and actions
are available from a particular Squid since they vary between versions
and some depend on which particular components are built into that
Squid.

The menu lists:

  - the report or action name

  - a short description about what it is

  - whether or not it is
    
      - public - available to anyone with manager access,
    
      - protected - available but requires a password,
    
      - hidden - not available due to configuration.

## Example report

  - this is an example from a default build of
    [Squid-3.2](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Features/CacheManager/Menu/Squid-3.2#).
    Remember the menu varies with available features.
