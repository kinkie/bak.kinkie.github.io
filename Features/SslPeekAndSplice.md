# Feature: SslBump Peek and Splice

  - **Goal**: Make bumping decisions after the origin server name is
    known, especially when transparently intercepting TLS/SSL. Avoid
    bumping non-TLS traffic.

  - **Status**: completed.

# Motivation

"Peek and Splice" is a collection of new
[SslBump](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Features/SslPeekAndSplice/Features/SslBump#)
actions and related features introduced in
[Squid-3.5](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Features/SslPeekAndSplice/Squid-3.5#).
Older Squids used server-first and client-first actions that did not
work well many cases. Many SslBump deployments try to minimize potential
damage by *not* bumping sites unless the local policy demands it. Before
the new actions became available, the decision to bump was made based on
very limited information:

  - A typical HTTP CONNECT request does not contain many details, and

  - intercepted TCP connections reveal nothing but IP addresses and port
    numbers.

Peek and Splice gives admin a way to make bumping decisions later in the
TLS handshake process, when client SNI and the server certificate are
available. Or when it becomes clear that we are not dealing with a TLS
connection at all\!

# Terminology

In most cases, this page uses *TLS* to mean *TLS or SSL*.

# Overview

The Peek and Splice feature looks at the TLS Client Hello message and
SNI info (if any), sends an identical or similar (to the extent
possible) Client Hello message to the server, and then looks at the TLS
Server Hello message.

The final decision to splice, bump, or terminate the connection can be
made at any of those steps (but what Squid does at step N affects its
ability to splice or bump at step N+1\!).

Please see the [actions table](#Actions) below for definitions of the
two "looking at" actions (i.e., peek and stare) as well as various final
actions (e.g., "bump", "splice", "terminate", etc.).

## Processing steps

Bumping Squid goes through several TCP and TLS "handshaking" steps.
Peeking steps give Squid more information about the client or server but
often limit the actions that Squid may perform in the future. The image
shows a simplified data flow and related events between a TLS client and
a TLS server. Note that with a bumping proxy between the client and the
server *_the flow is duplicated_* where the first flow is between client
and proxy and the second flow between proxy and server.

![TLS handshake between client and
server](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=TLS-handshake-02.png)

**Step 1:**

1.  Get TCP-level info from the client.
    
      - In forward proxy environments, also parse the CONNECT request.
    
      - In interception environments, create a fake CONNECT request
        using TCP-level info.

2.  Go through the [Callout
    Sequence](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Features/SslPeekAndSplice/SquidFaq/OrderIsImportant#Callout_Sequence)
    with the CONNECT request mentioned above.

3.  Evaluate all
    [ssl\_bump](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/ssl_bump#) rules
    and perform the first matching action (splice, bump, peek, stare, or
    terminate).

Step 1 is the only step that is always performed.

The CONNECT request is logged in access.log.

Note that for intercepted HTTPS traffic there is no "domain name"
available at this point. The log entry will contain only the destination
IP address and port. The same is true for some real CONNECT requests in
a forward proxy environments.

**Step 2:**

1.  Get TLS Client Hello info from the client, including SNI where
    available. Adjust the CONNECT request from step1 to reflect SNI.

2.  Go through the [Callout
    Sequence](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Features/SslPeekAndSplice/SquidFaq/OrderIsImportant#Callout_Sequence)
    with the adjusted CONNECT request mentioned above.

3.  Evaluate again all
    [ssl\_bump](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/ssl_bump#) rules
    and perform the first matching action (splice, bump, peek, stare, or
    terminate).
    
      - Peeking at this step usually makes bumping at step 3 impossible.
    
      - Staring at this step usually makes splicing at step 3
        impossible.

Step 2 is only performed if a peek or stare rule matched during the
previous step.

The adjusted CONNECT request is logged in access.log during this step if
this step is final (i.e., there is no step 3). However, when splicing,
the adjusted CONNECT becomes attached to the resulting tunnel and is not
logged until that tunnel is closed.

**Step 3:**

1.  Get TLS Server Hello info from the server, including the server
    certificate.

2.  Validate the TLS server certificate.

3.  Evaluate again all
    [ssl\_bump](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/ssl_bump#) rules
    and perform the first matching action (splice, bump, or terminate)
    for the connection.

Step 3 is only performed if a peek or stare rule matched during the
previous step.

The adjusted CONNECT request from the previous step is always logged in
access.log during this step (if Squid gets to this step, of course).
However, when splicing, the adjusted CONNECT becomes attached to the
resulting tunnel and is not logged until that tunnel is closed.

In most cases, the only meaningful choice at step 3 is whether to
terminate the connection. The splicing or bumping decision is usually
dictated by either peeking or staring at the previous step.

Squid configuration has to balance the desire to gain more information
(by delaying the final action) with the requirement to perform a certain
final action (which sometimes cannot be delayed any further).

## Actions

Several actions are possible when a proxy handles a TLS connection. See
the [ssl\_bump](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/ssl_bump#)
directive in your squid.conf.documented for a list of actions your
version of Squid supports. Some actions are only possible during certain
processing steps (see above). During a given processing step, Squid
(3.5.8 and later) *ignores*
[ssl\_bump](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/ssl_bump#) lines with
impossible actions. This helps us keep configuration sane. Processing
steps are discussed further below.

Actions splice, bump, and terminate are final actions: They prevent
further processing of the
[ssl\_bump](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/ssl_bump#) rules.
Actions peek and stare allow Squid to proceed to the next SslBump step.

## Configuration Examples

**IMPORTANT :**

  - ![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
    If you use **dstdomain** ACL before the HTTP connection is bumped,
    please note that it will attempt to match the (fake or real) CONNECT
    request URI. Depending on your listening ports configuration,
    browser behavior, the current SslBump step, and other factors, that
    URI may be just an IP address, and the reverse lookup of that IP
    address may not be the origin server domain name(s) in the encrypted
    requests. The **ssl::server\_name**
    [acl](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/acl#) type may use (fake
    or real) CONNECT request URI, TLS client SNI, and server certificate
    subject information. It also has knobs to control which bits of
    information are used. However, it does not perform DNS lookups. Read
    [acl](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/acl#) documentation for
    your Squid version and choose carefully.

  - ![{i}](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/icon-info.png)
    Selecting an action only to happen at a particular step can be done
    using an **at\_step** type
    [acl](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/acl#).

    # common acls for the following examples:

    acl monitoredSites ssl::server_name .foo.example.com

### Basic Splicing and Bumping

Only observe TCP/TLS metadata. Do not look at HTTP information. Modify
nothing. Useful for logging purposes since the SNI and server
certificates are peeked at and can be logged.

![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
Depending on other settings, Squid may terminate connections if it
cannot validate client SNI (Host header forgery detection) or the server
certificate.

    ssl_bump peek all
    ssl_bump splice all

Only bump a set of sites.

![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
Usually does not work for requests without SNI that go to monitoredSites
-- they will not be bumped.

    ssl_bump bump monitoredSites
    ssl_bump peek all
    ssl_bump splice all

Bump All Sites Except Banks

![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
Usually does not work for requests that go to non-banks -- they will not
be bumped.

![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
Depending on other settings, Squid may terminate connections to banks if
Squid cannot validate client SNI (Host header forgery detection) or the
server certificate.

    ssl_bump splice serverIsBank
    ssl_bump peek all
    ssl_bump bump all

### Peek at SNI and Bump

SNI is obtained by parsing TLS Client Hello during step \#2 (which is
instructed by *ssl\_bump peek step1*). Parsing TLS Client Hello does
*not* preclude future bumping. If you want to get SNI and bump, then
peek at step \#1 and bump at the next step (i.e., step \#2):

    acl step1 at_step SslBump1
    ssl_bump peek step1
    ssl_bump bump monitoredSites !serverIsBank
    ssl_bump splice all

Please note that making decisions based on steps \#1 and \#2 info alone
gives you no knowledge about the TLS server point of view. All your
decisions will be based on what the TLS *client* has told you. This is
often not a problem because, in most cases, if the client lies (e.g.,
sends "bank.example.com" SNI to a "non-bank.example.com" server), the
TLS server will refuse to establish the \[bumped or spliced at step
\#2\] connection with Squid. However, not all servers will do that and
it is trivial to setup a malicious forwarding TLS server that will not.
Also, if the client supplied no SNI information at all (e.g., you are
dealing with IE on Windows XP), then your ACLs may not have enough
information to go on during those first two steps, especially for
intercepted connections.

If you also peek at step \#2, you will know the server certificate, but
you will no longer be able to bump the connection in most cases (see
Limitations below).

### Peek at SNI and Splice

The following configuration obtains SNI by parsing TLS Client Hello (due
to a matching peek rule at step1) and then either splices bank
connections OR stares at the TLS Server Hello (due to a matching stare
rule) and bumps non-bank connections (due to the default
bump-after-stare rule).

    ssl_bump peek step1
    ssl_bump splice serverIsBank
    ssl_bump stare all

In the above configuration, the decision to splice (if any) is made
during step \#2 (and only during that step). The decision to bump (if
any) is made during step \#3 (and only during that step), using the
default rule driven by the matching stare rule at step2. That late
bumping decision allows Squid to mimic server certificate properties
when bumping. The cost (i.e. cons) of that late bumping is the necessity
to make the splicing decision based exclusively on client-supplied
information.

This configuration was
[discussed](http://lists.squid-cache.org/pipermail/squid-users/2018-September/019150.html)
at length on the Squid users mailing list.

Please note that for splicing to work at a future step, the Client Hello
message must be sent "as is", without any modifications at all. On the
other hand, sending the Client Hello message "as is" precludes Squid
from eventually bumping the connection in most real-world use cases.
Thus, the decision whether to mimic the Client Hello (as staring does)
or send it "as is" (as peeking does) is critical to Squid's ability to
splice or bump the connection after the Hello message has been sent.

# Limitations

## Peeking at the server often precludes bumping

To peek at the server certificate, Squid must forward the entire Client
Hello intact. If that Client Hello or the server response contains any
TLS extensions that Squid does not support or understand (many do\!),
then Squid cannot reliably bump the connection because the other two
sides of that bumped communication may start using those extensions,
confusing Squid's OpenSSL in unpredictable ways. Possible solutions or
workarounds (all deficient in various ways):

1.  If bumping is more valuable/important than splicing in your
    environment, you should "stare" instead of peeking. Staring usually
    precludes future splicing, of course. Pick your poison.

2.  We could add an ACL that will tell you whether those extensions and
    other complications are present in Client Hello. This is doable, but
    if that ACL usually evaluates to "yes", do we really want to do all
    this extra development and then complicate Squid configurations?

3.  We could teach Squid to understand more TLS extensions. This may
    require significant low-level work (because we would have to do what
    OpenSSL cannot do for us). This approach may eventually cover many
    popular cases, but will never cover everything and will require
    ongoing additions, of course.

4.  Squid could ignore the client and/or server extensions and try to
    bump anyway. The exact results cannot be predicted, but will often
    be a total transaction failure, possibly with user-visible browser
    warnings.

5.  We could teach Squid to abandon the current server connection and
    then bump a newly open one. This is something we do not want to do
    as it is likely to create an even worse operational problems with
    Squids being auto-blocked for opening and closing connections in
    vain.

## TLS session resumption

During TLS session resumption, there is no server certificate for Squid
to examine. The initial implementation does not try to find the implied
server certificate by caching session information, but even with such a
cache (indexed by the session ticket), there is no guarantee that the
certificate will be found in the Squid cache. Moreover, session caching
itself may require bumping to learn the session ticket (TLS
[NewSessionTicket](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077#section-3.3)
message comes after the initial handshake)\! The admin has to decide
whether sessions missing server certificates are going to be spliced
with little or no information available about the server.

More limitations are TBD.

# Logging

## %ssl::bump\_mode logformat code

Squid logs a single access.log record to reflect CONNECT request
handling. If you add %ssl::bump\_mode to your logformat definition, its
value in that record would depend on Squid version:

  - Squid v3.5 logs the first ssl\_bump decision (usually a step1
    action);

  - Squid v4+ logs the final ssl\_bump decision (usually the last used
    ssl\_bump action).

If the tunnel is bumped, then each bumped HTTP request is also logged,
of course. The %ssl::bump\_mode value in those records is the final
SslBump decision. Naturally, that value is either "bump" or one of the
deprecated bumping actions (i.e. "server-first" or "client-first"). This
logging behavior of bumped requests is the same for all modern Squid
versions.

Here are two version-specific tables that document expected
%ssl::bump\_mode value for CONNECT and bumped requests.

Squid v3.5 logs:

|                             |                  |           |              |                     |

Squid v4+ logs:

| client-first                | \-               | \-        | client-first | client-first        |

The difference between the two tables is in the CONNECT column: Rows
with multiple SslBump steps differ.
