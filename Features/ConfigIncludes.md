# Details

Other popular software, most notably apache, have long had the
capability of breaking their large or complex configurations into
smaller more manageable files which are included into the main
configuration.

This feature adds similar properties to the squid.conf file.

## Squid Configuration

squid.conf is processed top-down sequentially, many of the options
depend on this order for their effects when run. The **include** option
effectively recurses down into another file or set of files at the
position of the include.

**include** is an option like all, to be configured on a line of its
own.

The basic config method is to explicitly include each external file into
squid.conf where it should be processed. For example;

    http_port 3128
    include /etc/squid/refresh_patterns.conf
    include /etc/squid/peers.conf
    ...

Alternatively on unix-based systems the ability to include an entire
folders worth of files is provided.

    http_port 3128
    include /etc/squid/conf.d/*.conf
    ...

This will include a sorted list of files matching the pattern in order
at the include position.

# Future Developments

With this feature available it permits the development of a library of
configuration snippets to be easily shared between the squid user
community.

We hope to provide a repository of config examples for general use. Some
work has been done towards this in the [Config
Examples](/ConfigExamples#)
section.
