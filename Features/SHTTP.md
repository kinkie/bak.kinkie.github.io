# Feature: SHTTP (Secure HTTP messaging)

  - **Version**: none

  - **More**: RFC [2660](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2660#), RFC
    [8188](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8188#),
    [Features/HTTPS](/Features/HTTPS#)

When a client needs to transmit sensitive content securely over
potentially insecure or untrusted network connections it can do several
things;

  - encrypt communications using the S-HTTP protocol defined in RFC
    [2660](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2660#), or

  - encrypt the message payload using HTTP mechanism defined in RFC
    [8188](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8188#), or

  - use a TLS encrypted connection (see
    [Features/HTTPS](/Features/HTTPS#))

# Encrypted S-HTTP messaging

Squid does not (yet) support the RFC
[2660](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2660#) protocol.

# Encrypted HTTP message payload

The RFC [8188](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8188#) HTTP extension
defines encryption as just another a payload encoding. Squid supports
this protocol for all traffic cached.

Squid does not (yet) support acting as an end-client for resources using
encryption coding.

Squid does not (yet) support acting as surrogate (reverse-proxy)
performing encoding operations for this content. Only relay messages to
an external service.
