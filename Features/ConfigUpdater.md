# Details

Currently users are left with manually reading the release notes or
online help with every upgrade between versions of Squid. When upgrading
across several versions for example Squid 2.5 to 3.1 there are multiple
sets of detailed release notes to wade through.

Starting with
[Squid-3.2](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Features/ConfigUpdater/Squid-3.2#)
obsolete config directives are identified and upgrade instructions are
printed out when `squid -k parse` command is used, or to cache.log if
Squid is simply run without checking the config validity.

This project will have the side effect of also replacing all the obscure
**Bungled Config** messages with meaningful instructions for both what
is wrong with the config line and what to do about it.

## Issues

  - sometimes old single tag options have been replaced by more complex
    options nested within another setting. For example the multiple
    Squid-2.5 httpd\_\* options migrate to sub-options on a specific
    [http\_port](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/http_port#) tag.

  - squid developers are continually improving squid.conf settings and
    the systems behind them so the system must be easily updated.

  - might be done best as a built-in parser processing path. However the
    current parsers (plural\!) and configure
    startup/restart/reload/shutdown pathways all need to be re-worked
    properly before this can be built-in. see
    [Features/HotConf](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Features/ConfigUpdater/Features/HotConf#)
    for details on that work.

  - some options are supported, but not by the current set of
    ./configure options. The parser \#if-\#endif need to be re-worked to
    provide instructions about when directive to re-build squid with to
    get the option.
    
      - NP: this is already done for *directives* but not for
        sub-options where the directive is parsed (ie
        *[http\_port](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/http_port#)
        ... sslcacert=/foo* still comes up as bungled config).

## Malformed Config Logic

Some common mistakes users have trouble with are caused by wrong config
being "accepted" by Squid but not having the effect they expected.
Having the parser detect these cases and warn about them would be good.

  - access lists being configured when the relevant protocol has no
    ports open (ie
    [icp\_port](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/icp_port#)
    disabled and
    [icp\_access](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/icp_access#)
    configured)

  - "\!all" token being used on a one-line fast ACL (ie `  access_log
    /var/log/access.log squid !all `) preventing the line from ever
    matching. It is useful trick on multi-line access lists, but on
    single-lines not so much.

  - allow/deny all being used halfway down a multi-line access list. In
    complex configs these are not always obvious. The parser could scan
    for and report these cases when found.

  - detecting the more general case where a line is testing an ACL which
    can never produce a match. Neither line two or three below can ever
    match. **But** line 2 can be there in order to trigger ACL
    "something".

<!-- end list -->

``` 
 http_access allow foo
 http_access deny something foo
 http_access deny foo somethingelse
```

  - a series of allow or deny lines followed by the same with just
    **all**. NP: Might be wanted if the foo and bar ACL have certain
    types (external, auth, ident, dst, srcdomain) but for most types
    they will be useless config.

<!-- end list -->

    http_access deny foo
    http_access deny bar
    http_access deny all

  - delay pool with
    [delay\_parameters](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/delay_parameters#)
    limits all set to *-1/-1*.

  - directives configured to their default value. Not a major problem,
    but one worth logging to help simplify large config files.
    Particularly now that modern Squid have a default for each
    directive.

### Solutions

Stuff done in
[Squid-3.2](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Features/ConfigUpdater/Squid-3.2#):

  - obsolete directives are kept in `cf.data.pre` with the type
    **obsolete**. The documentation comments are printed as upgrade
    instructions on how to handle the directives (remove or change).

  - alias directives are detected. A deprecation message is printed out
    instructing that the config be changed to the new name.

  - directives for components missing from the build are ignored. A
    message indicating the missing component or build requirements is
    logged.
