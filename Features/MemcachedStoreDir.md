# Details

[Memcached](http://www.danga.com/memcached/) is a popular mechanism for
storing out-of-process RAM-based caches, in some cases (e.g. facebook)
of huge proportions. It would make sense to create an asyncrhonous
storedir which talks to one or more memcached-based backends for storing
contents, possibly using selectors a la
[COSS](/Features/CyclicObjectStorageSystem#)
to maximize the performance gains.
