The **Cache Manager CGI** is a tool that provides basic management
capabilities of a Squid server through a HTML user interface. As every
[Common\_Gateway\_Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface#),
it requires an HTTP server to make it really run.

The communication with the Squid server is made up using the [Cache
Object
Protocol](/CacheObjectProtocol#),
that provides access to the underlying [Cache
Manager](/CacheManager#).

More information is currently available at
[Features/CacheManager](/Features/CacheManager#).
