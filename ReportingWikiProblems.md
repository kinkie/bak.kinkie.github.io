# Reporting Wiki Problems

If you experience problems with the wiki layout or engine, please file a
bug in [Bugzilla](http://bugs.squid-cache.org/), using the "Website"
product and "wiki" component. Please make sure to specify what browser
you are using, what page you are trying to access, and if possible
attach a screenshot showing the problem that you're having.

Problems with the wiki **contents** can be reported in the same way, but
the recommended solution in this case is to get involved, please see
[FrontPage](/FrontPage#)
for information on how to do so.

Thanks\!
