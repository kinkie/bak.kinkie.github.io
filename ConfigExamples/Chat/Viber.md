# Viber Messenger

**Warning**: Any example presented here is provided "as-is" with no
support or guarantee of suitability. If you have any further questions
about these examples please email the squid-users mailing list.

## Outline

[Viber Messenger](https://viber.com) is end-to-end encryption
messenger/VoIP/group chats/file transfers application. Using it may be
prohibited by corporate security policy.

## Usage

Usually Viber works in most Squid's setups without any additional
configuration. Blocking it, however, require some additional steps. To
block Viber, you require SSL Bump-aware squid, or, at least,
[peek-n-splice](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice)
configuration.

## Squid Configuration File

Paste the configuration file like this:

    # Block Viber
    acl deny_viber ssl::server_name_regex .viber\.com
    acl DiscoverSNIHost at_step SslBump1
    ssl_bump peek DiscoverSNIHost
    ssl_bump terminate deny_viber
    ssl_bump splice all

then reconfigure Squid.

This is enough to make Viber fully unoperable (both desktop/mobile).
