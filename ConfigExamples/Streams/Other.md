    For you, should not come as a surprise that many popular video
    services using incorrect mime-types to counteract blocking by proxy
    operators. For example, porn sites that utilize text mime-types for
    video. Accordingly, not only can you use the above method to block
    videos from such sites. Besides, is not uncommon incorrect
    mime-encoding due to incorrect configuration of a number of sites.
