# Blocking YouTube Videos

**Warning**: Any example presented here is provided "as-is" with no
support or guarantee of suitability. If you have any further questions
about these examples please email the squid-users mailing list.

## Outline

This example covers the blocking of all YouTube.com videos. Which is
actually very easy.

Caching them is now impossible, for information on that see
[ConfigExamples/DynamicContent/YouTube/Discussion](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/ConfigExamples/Streams/YouTube/ConfigExamples/DynamicContent/YouTube/Discussion#)

## Squid Configuration File

Add this to squid.conf before the part where you allow people access to
the Internet.

    As of Feb 2014 Google are using one subdomain of youtube.com for
    authenticating **all** google services, including Docs and Gmail. If
    you were intending to block only YouTube access this needs to be
    whitelisted from the denial.

<!-- end list -->

    ## The videos come from several domains
    acl youtube_domains dstdomain .youtube.com .googlevideo.com .ytimg.com
    
    ## G* services authentication domain
    acl gLogin dstdomain accounts.youtube.com
    
    http_access deny youtube_domains !gLogin

Other sites than YouTube also host this kind of content. See the Flash
Video section of
[ConfigExamples/Streams/Other](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/ConfigExamples/Streams/YouTube/ConfigExamples/Streams/Other#)
for general flash media patterns withut needing to block specific
websites.

To block not all YT, but some clips, use focused acl rule:

    # Block YT clips
    acl yt_clips url_regex .youtube\.com\/watch\?v=lr_m3GW5Cws
    http_access deny yt_clips

You also can specify clips list as file.
