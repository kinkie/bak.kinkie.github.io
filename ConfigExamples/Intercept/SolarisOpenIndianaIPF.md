# Intercepting traffic with IPFilter on Solaris/OpenIndiana

  - *by

**Warning**: Any example presented here is provided "as-is" with no
support or guarantee of suitability. If you have any further questions
about these examples please email the squid-users mailing list.

## Outline

**NOTE:** NAT configuration will only work when used **on the squid
box**. This is required to perform intercept accurately and securely. To
intercept from a gateway machine and direct traffic at a separate squid
box use [policy
routing](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/ConfigExamples/Intercept/SolarisOpenIndianaIPF/ConfigExamples/Intercept/IptablesPolicyRoute#).

We need to intercept incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic on Solaris/OpenIndiana
box with Squid proxy. In this example server has two aggregated 1 Gbit
interfaces, bge0+bge1:

    # ifconfig bge0 down
    # ifconfig bge0 unplumb
    
    # dladm create-aggr -d bge0 -d bge1 1
    # ifconfig aggr1 plumb
    # ifconfig aggr1 192.168.200.3/24 up
    # mv /etc/hostname.bge0 /etc/hostname.aggr1

**Note:** Using LACP for aggregated links required adequate
configuration managed switch on other side, if used.

## Usage

This configuration useful with transparent interception proxy in DMZ,
with zero client configuration.

**Note:** We can intercept only IPv4 traffic.

## Configure Squid

Squid must be configured with ipf-transparent option:

    ./configure '--enable-ipf-transparent'

**Note:** You don't need any authentification options, because of no
auth in transparent interception mode. Also, be sure your Squid is
**really** built with Intercept module (see bug
[3754](https://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3754#)).

## Configure IPFilter

You need to edit /etc/ipt/ipnat.conf as follows:

    rdr aggr1 0.0.0.0/0 port 80 -> 0/32 port 3126
    rdr aggr1 0.0.0.0/0 port 443 -> 0/32 port 3127

In case of proxy placed in DMZ, will be good to configure IPFilter as
closed firewall by edit /etc/ipt/ipf.conf as follows:

    # Transparent proxy host
    #
    # Host proxyhost with one interface:
    # aggr1 - aggregated (bge0+bge1)
    #
    
    # Group 100 - Blocked networks & packets on any interface
    # Group 100 setup
    block in all head 100
    # Group 200 - Opened incoming ports & services on aggr1
    # Group 200 setup
    pass in on aggr1 head 200
    
    # ---------------------
    # Common blocking rules
    # ---------------------
    # Block all IP fragments
    block in quick all with frag group 100
    
    # Block all short IP fragments
    block in quick proto tcp all with short group 100
    
    # Block any IP packets with options set in them 
    block in quick all with ipopts group 100
    
    # Make sure the loopback allows packets to traverse it
    # ---------------------- lo0 interface --------------------------
    pass in quick on lo0 all
    pass out quick on lo0 all
    # ---------------------- lo0 interface --------------------------
    
    # Allow ICMP Echo on aggr1 from internal networks
    pass in quick on aggr1 proto icmp from 192.168.0.0/16 to proxyhost icmp-type echo group 200
    # Permit DNS access to Unbound
    pass in quick proto tcp/udp from 192.168.0.0/16 to proxyhost port=53 keep state keep frag group 200
    # Allow incoming NTP requests to NTP-server. Restrict access from LAN only
    pass in quick on aggr1 proto udp from 192.168.0.0/16 to proxyhost port=ntp keep state group 200
    # Permit access to SSH
    pass in quick proto tcp from any to proxyhost port=2222 flags S keep state keep frag group 200
    # Restrict access to proxy by WCCP from DMZ only
    pass in quick on aggr1 proto udp from 192.168.200.0/24 to proxyhost port=2048 keep state keep frags group 200
    # Restrict access to proxy only from localnet (interception)
    pass in quick proto tcp from 192.168.0.0/16 to proxyhost port=3126 flags S keep state keep frag group 200
    # Restrict access to proxy only from localnet (HTTPS interception)
    pass in quick proto tcp from 192.168.0.0/16 to proxyhost port=3127 flags S keep state keep frag group 200
    # Restrict access to proxy only from localnet (forwarding)
    pass in quick proto tcp from 192.168.0.0/16 to proxyhost port=3128 flags S keep state keep frag group 200
    # Restrict access to ICP only from localnet
    pass in quick proto tcp from 192.168.0.0/16 to proxyhost port=3130 flags S keep state keep frag group 200
    # Restrict access to HTCP only from localnet
    pass in quick proto tcp from 192.168.0.0/16 to proxyhost port=4827 flags S keep state keep frag group 200
    # Restrict access to proxy Web server
    pass in quick proto tcp from 192.168.0.0/16 to proxyhost port=8080 flags S keep state keep frag group 200
    # Restrict access to proxy Web server
    pass in quick proto tcp from 192.168.0.0/16 to proxyhost port=8088 flags S keep state keep frag group 200
    # Restrict access to proxy Web server
    pass in quick proto tcp from 192.168.0.0/16 to proxyhost port=8888 flags S keep state keep frag group 200
    
    # Allow packets originating from local machine out
    pass out quick proto tcp/udp from any to any keep state keep frags
    pass out quick proto icmp from any to any keep state
    
    # Finally block any unmatched
    block in on aggr1 all

## Squid 3.x Configuration File

Paste the configuration file like this:

    http_port 3126 intercept
    
    https_port 3127 intercept ssl-bump generate-host-certificates=on dynamic_cert_mem_cache_size=4MB cert=/usr/local/squid/etc/rootCA.crt key=/usr/local/squid/etc/rootCA.key capath=/etc/opt/csw/ssl/certs
    
    http_port 3128

## Finally you need to enable/restart IPFilter and Squid proxy

    # svcadm enable ipfilter
    # svcadm restart squid

That's all, folks.
