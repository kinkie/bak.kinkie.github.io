# Linux traffic Interception using DNAT

**Warning**: Any example presented here is provided "as-is" with no
support or guarantee of suitability. If you have any further questions
about these examples please email the squid-users mailing list.

## Outline

To Intercept IPv4 web requests transparently without any kind of client
configuration. When web traffic is reaching the machine squid is run on.

**NOTE:** NAT configuration will only work when used **on the squid
box**. This is required to perform intercept accurately and securely. To
intercept from a gateway machine and direct traffic at a separate squid
box use [policy
routing](/ConfigExamples/Intercept/IptablesPolicyRoute#).

## iptables configuration

Replace **SQUIDIP** with the public IP which squid may use for its
listening port and outbound connections. Replace **SQUIDPORT** with the
port in squid.conf set with **intercept** flag.

Due to the NAT security vulnerabilities it is also a **very good idea**
to block external access to the internal receiving port. This has to be
done in the **mangle** part of iptables before DNAT happens so that
intercepted traffic does not get dropped.

Without the first iptables line here being first, your setup may
encounter problems with forwarding loops.

    # your proxy IP
    SQUIDIP=192.168.0.2
    
    # your proxy listening port
    SQUIDPORT=3129
    
    
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s $SQUIDIP -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination $SQUIDIP:$SQUIDPORT
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
    iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport $SQUIDPORT -j DROP

**NOTE:** DNAT is only available for IPv4 traffic on older kernel
versions. For IPv6 interception use [TPROXY
version 4](/Features/Tproxy4#).

## /etc/sysctl.conf Configuration

    # Controls IP packet forwarding
    net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
    
    # Controls source route verification
    net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 0
    
    # Do not accept source routing
    net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0

## Squid Configuration File

You will need to configure squid to know the IP is being intercepted
like so:

    http_port 3129 transparent

  - ![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
    In Squid 3.1+ the *transparent* option has been split. Use
    **'intercept** to catch DNAT packets.

<!-- end list -->

    http_port 3129 intercept
