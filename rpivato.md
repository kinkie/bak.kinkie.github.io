# Rafael Pivato

As a network administrator I used Squid as the key point to give
Internet access to my users.

My current work here will be helping the community with my best
providing nice and clean documentation in this Wiki.

During this process I expect to learn even more about Squid-Cache to
provide higher quality consultancy services.

    example](/ConfigExamples#).

## Done

    They are still very short, but will let it as is for a while... for
    public scrutiny.
