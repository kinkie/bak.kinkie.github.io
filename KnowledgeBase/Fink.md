# Compiling

Squid compiles on Mac OS X. However, there are some steps required
before following the general build instructions.

  - **Install Xcode**
    
    1.  From Mac OS X, run the "AppStore" application.
    
    2.  Locate "Xcode", Apple's development environment.
    
    3.  Install "Xcode".

  - **Install Command-Line Tools**
    
    1.  Launch "Xcode".
    
    2.  Open "Xcode | Preferences".
    
    3.  Bring up the "Downloads" tab.
    
    4.  Under "Components" click the "Install" button for "Command Line
        Tools".
    
    5.  Quit Xcode.

  - **Verify Command-Line Tools**
    
    1.  Launch "Terminal", usually located in the "Utilities" folder
        under "Applications".
    
    2.  Run "gcc --version". Manually verify this produces sane output.

From this point, the [general build
instructions](/SquidFaq/CompilingSquid#How_do_I_compile_Squid.3F)
should be all you need.

    It is worth noting this platform doesn't support EUI. The
    --enable-eui ./configure will cause build errors.
