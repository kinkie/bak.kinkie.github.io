Many Squid users are interested in filtering MSN, Yahoo, Google, Skype
and similar protocols through the proxy server. Squid is a HTTP proxy
and thus can only filter HTTP - so this relies on:

  - General desktops/workstations aren't able to directly connect to the
    internet; and

  - All their internet access is manually configured to use Squid as a
    HTTP proxy.

Assuming this holds true, you may be able to filter a number of chat
related protocols. The best way to do this in your environment is to use
a few chat programs, monitor your access logs and block sites
appropriately.

This article is intended to be a guide to help Squid Administrators
configure filters applicable to their environment. If you notice these
instructions are incomplete or incorrect then please feel free to
request editor privileges and update the information.
