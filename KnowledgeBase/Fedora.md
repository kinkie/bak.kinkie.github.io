# Squid on Fedora

## Pre-Built Binary Packages

Binary RPMs for Fedora are available via the Fedora download/update
servers for all active Fedora versions like most other free software.
Note that Fedora releases have an approximately [13 month life
cycle](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Life_Cycle), so
information on this page may not be current.
