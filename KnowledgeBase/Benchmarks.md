# Most Current Squid Benchmarks

Speed and Requirement details of squid are a little hard to come by at
present. Here is a list of the community contributed achievements.

If you are running any release of squid and can provide the same details
with a better requests-per-second than one listed we would like to know
about it.

Sorted by Squid Release and CPU.

# Method of Calculation

There is no good fixed benchmark test yet to measure by so comparisons
are not strictly correct. Here is how the follow details are calculated:

  - At an administrator estimated peak traffic time run **squidclient
    mgr:info** or otherwise pull the info report from **cachemgr.cgi**

|           |                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Users     | Maximum value seen for **Number of clients accessing cache**.                                                                                                      |
| RPS       | Add all number for **Average \*\*\* requests per minute since start** together and divide by 60 for per-second                                                     |
| Hit Ratio | Values of **Request Hit Ratios**: 5min - 60min . Only total hit ratio matters here. disk and memory hit ratios are highly specific to the amount of RAM available. |
| CPU Load  | It can be extracted from the **general runtime information** or **info** cachemgr page. It's the value marked "CPU Usage"                                          |

| Hit Ratio | 100%                                                       |
| CPU Usage | 3 cores at 100%                                            |
| Bandwidth | 313 Mbit/sec sustained                                     |

This number was taken in a **controlled test environment**. It has
nothing to do with the numbers someone would get in a production
environment; it's just an estimate of how fast squid can be. Squid was
configured to do no logging, no access control, and apachebench was used
to hammer squid asking 10M times for a static, cacheable, 600-bytes long
document. Of the 4 cores, 3 were running a multi-worker squid, one was
running ab over the loopback interface.

    This is achieved using laboratory tests with Web Polygraph for raw request throughput with no SMP workers engaged.
    
    This is published as a theoretical median for high performance. Faster/newer hardware will reach higher throughput at peak and most networks will not reach this rate in real production traffic.

    We have to handle mostly very, very small files which is
    a real pain. So COSS was my white knight to handle this.
    
    Although we don't use CARP we made sure that the proxies always get the
    same requests. We have at our prime time about 40 MBit/s outgoing
    traffic which makes about 1000 requests per second.
    
    Also I should mention that we use a standard Debian kernel with no
    tuning in any kernel parameters except the following two:
      net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 4096
      vm.swappiness = 0

    Cache: 1x 600GB. With this hit ratio and cache size, substantial cpu time is spent in iowait
    as the disk is overloaded.  Reducing the cache to 450GB relieves this, but
    the hit rate drops to more like 10-11%.

## Squid 2.5

NP: probably 2.5.STABLE7 or earlier going by the release dates.

# Other Benchmarking

## SquidBlocker 2015

The test is for one proxy which runs a url filtering DB helper. The
helper runs http queries against one reverse proxy which
[RoundRobin](/RoundRobin#)
load balance to three backend DB servers. The squid settings:

    workers 2
    visible_hostname proxy2
    
    external_acl_type filter_url ipv4 children-max=20 children-startup=10 children-idle=5 concurrency=50 ttl=3 %URI %METHOD %un /usr/bin/sblocker_client -http=http://filterdb:8082/sb/01
    acl filter_url_acl external filter_url
    deny_info http://ngtech.co.il/block_page/?url=%u&domain=%H filter_url_acl
    
    acl localnet src 192.168.0.0/16
    
    http_access deny !filter_url_acl
    http_access allow localnet filter_url_acl
    access_log none

This number was taken in a **controlled test environment**. It has
nothing to do with the numbers someone would get in a production
environment; it's just an estimate of how fast squid can be. Squid was
configured to do no logging and apachebench was used to hammer squid
asking 250K times for a blocked url (leading to a 403 response with a
location header) or with a cacheable, 16KB long document. Of the 4
cores, 2 were running a multi-worker squid. The apache benchmark was run
from another host and from the same host with similar results.

Mark Nottingham benchmarked Squid 2.5 vs 2.6 in late 2006:
[](http://www.mnot.net/blog/2006/08/21/caching_performance)

The Measurement Factory benchmarked Squid 2.4, in particular IO systems
in 2000 [](http://polygraph.ircache.net/Results/bakeoff-2/)

Bryan Migliorisi posted some analysis of
[Squid-2.6](/Squid-2.6#)
speeds under pressure on September 8th, 2009 at unfortunately a dynamic
website that disappeared on us.
