I am writing down the idea to make it public visible.

# HTTP Knocking

Similar to port knocking there is a way to implement a squid helper
which will provide an API to a HTTP helper that will somehow be
connected to some changing hashing\\coding system and will "open doors"
if needed.

# Honey Pot

Almost like the above idea squid can be used as a honey pot and will
trigger a block based on many of the request parts.
