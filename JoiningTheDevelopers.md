# How to become a Squid developer

The current Squid development model makes extensive use of branches,
where each developer or task is given a unique branch containing his
changes. Tools are provided to almost automatically keep the development
branches up to date with the main Squid version.

To become a Squid developer you need to have some knowledge of C++ code
and some tools covered in
[DeveloperResources](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/JoiningTheDevelopers/DeveloperResources#),
and then email <squid-dev@squid-cache.org> with your name and a short
introduction on who you are and your interest in Squid development.

Developers are assumed to know and follow these simple rules (separate
page)

The current developer projects are hosted by
[](http://code.launchpad.net/squid)

Older ones are hosted on devel.squid-cache.org. This service is built
around the service provided by [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net).
