# Installation

![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png) a
wide consensus has been reached towards replacing CVS with another more
modern Version Control solution. If you do not already have a VCS please
see
[BzrInstructions](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/CvsInstructions/BzrInstructions#).

# Repository Location

To checkout the current source tree from our CVS server:

``` 
  % setenv CVSROOT ':pserver:anoncvs@cvs.squid-cache.org:/squid'
  % cvs login
```

When prompted for a password, enter 'anoncvs'.

``` 
  % cvs checkout squid3
```

You can use `  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.squid-cache.org:/squid
checkout squid3  ` for a shorter all-in-one method that wont set
environment variables.

If you make automake related changes then you will need to bootstrap
your tree -

    sh bootstrap.sh

This may give errors if you don't have the right distribution-time
dependencies (libtool, automake \> 1.5, autoconf \> 2.61).

To update your source tree later, type:

``` 
  % cvs update
```

## Repository Mirrors

``` 
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.devel.squid-cache.org:/cvsroot/squid login
```

  - ..blank password, just press enter...

<!-- end list -->

``` 
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.devel.squid-cache.org:/cvsroot/squid co -rHEAD -d squid-HEAD squid3
```

  - ![{i}](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/icon-info.png)
    Squid-3 STABLE branches are not mirrored in CVS.

[BzrInstructions](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/CvsInstructions/BzrInstructions#)
and use the Bazaar instead.
