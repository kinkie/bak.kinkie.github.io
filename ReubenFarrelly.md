I've been doing things with Squid for a few years now. In the past I
have maintained Squid boxes for several ISPs and at present work as a
Field Network Engineer where I configure and maintain mostly cisco
network equipment.

My contributions are usually along the lines of testing and submitting
small patches (I'm not fluent in C).

Of recent times I have contributed a fair amount to the Squid-2.6
release and tidied up documentation in the new Squid wiki.
