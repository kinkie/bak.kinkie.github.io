# Steven Wilton

Steven submitted patches to implement true transparent proxying (using
TPROXYv2 with Linux), WCCPv2 support and pinned connections to allow
NTLM session pass-through. He then turned to improving Adrian's work on
COSS and testing it in the field, making it production ready and useful
in the real world.
