# Squid Build Farm

The Squid project aims to ensure compatibility with a big number of
OSes. Aim of the Build Farm effort is to ensure that at least some
testing is done on all platforms we can, and we rely on a number of
Docker containers and virtual machines running on hosts kindly donated
by volunteers and by [DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com/).

[FrancescoChemolli](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/BuildFarm/FrancescoChemolli#)
is leading this effort.

Project sysadmins can find documentation on the Docker farm at
[BuildFarm/DockerBuildFarm](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/BuildFarm/BuildFarm/DockerBuildFarm#).
The images used to test our supported builds are available on the
[Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/squidcache/buildfarm), and
are built from instructions at
[GitHub](https://github.com/kinkie/dockerfiles) feel free to use them
for your own builds.
