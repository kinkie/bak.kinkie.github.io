Spoon Feeding is an optimization obtained by deploying a [Reverse
Proxy](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/SpoonFeeding/SquidFaq/ReverseProxy#).
Its purpose is to free up valuable computation resources by allowing
them to quickly complete the network part of their work to a very close
and fast intermediary (the reverse proxy), which can then send the data
to the remote clients as the network congestion conditions allow (spoon
feed the clients).

This is highly effective as the number of application threads is often a
limiting factor for high-volume websites, and they can be tied up for a
significant time by the need to actually send the data to the clients.
