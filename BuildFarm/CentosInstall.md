# System Setup

On top of the default system install, run

    # next step is only needed for RHEL/CentOS 6. Watch out for the version. Not needed for fedora
    root% rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    
    root% yum install libxml2 expat-devel openssl-devel libcap ccache libtool-ltdl-devel cppunit cppunit-devel bzr git autoconf automake libtool gcc-c++ perl-Pod-MinimumVersion bzip2 ed make openldap-devel  pam-devel db4-devel  libxml2-devel libcap-devel screen vim nettle-devel redhat-lsb-core autoconf-archive libtdb-devel libtdb
    root% useradd -m -G ccache jenkins
    
    #java. Select the right version and install it
    root% yum search headless
    
    # need to install llvm/clang by hand, as the supplied version is too ancient.
    # nettle is available for centos-5 but as of 2014-03 not for centos-6. Download and build from http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/archive/

set up permissions to the jenkins user, and that's it.

In case RPMs are to be built,

    yum install redhat-rpm-config rpm-build rpm-devel
    useradd rpm
    mkdir /home/rpm/rpmbuild
    cd /home/rpm/rpmbuild
    mkdir BUILD RPMS SOURCES SPECS SRPMS
    chown rpm. -R /home/rpm/rpmbuild
    su - rpm
    echo '%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild' > ~/.rpmmacros
    echo '%__make /usr/bin/make -j 9'>> ~/.rpmmacros
