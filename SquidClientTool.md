# squidclient Tool

This tool is a command line utility for performing web requests.

It also has a special ability to send cache manager requests to Squid
proxies.

## Cache manager access from squidclient

A simple way to test the access to the cache manager is:

    squidclient mgr:info

  - ![{i}](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/icon-info.png)
    If you are using a port other than *3128* on your Squid you will
    need to use the **-p** option to specify it.

See `squidclient -h` for more options.

To send a manager password (more on that below) there are two ways
depending on your Squid version.

  - squidclient version 3.1.\* and older you add **@** then the password
    to the URL. So that it looks like this `mgr:info@admin`.

  - squidclient version 3.2.\* use the proxy login options **-u** and
    **w** to pass your admin login to the cache manger.
