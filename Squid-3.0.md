| today    | Squid-3.0 is **CONSIDERED DANGEROUS** as the security people say. Due to unfixed vulnerabilities **[CVE-2014-7141](http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2014_4.txt), [CVE-2014-7142](http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2014_4.txt), [CVE-2014-6270](http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2014_3.txt), [CVE-2014-3609](http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2014_2.txt), [CVE-2012-5643](http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2012_1.txt), [CVE-2013-0189](http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2012_1.txt), [CVE-2009-0801](http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2011_1.txt)** and any other recently discovered issues. |

## Split Choice

As it stands, users will still need to make a choice between
[Squid-3.0](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Squid-3.0/Squid-3.0#)
and [Squid-2.7](#) when moving away from Squid-2.5 and
[Squid-2.6](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Squid-3.0/Squid-2.6#).
This decision needs to be made on the basis of their feature needs.

The only help we can provide for this is to point out that:

  - [Squid-3.0](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/Squid-3.0/Squid-3.0#)
    has been largely sponsored by the Web-Filtering user community. With
    features aimed at adapting and altering content in transit.

  - [Squid-2.7](#) has been largely sponsored by high-performance user
    community. With features aimed at Caching extremely high traffic
    volumes in the order of Terabytes per day.
