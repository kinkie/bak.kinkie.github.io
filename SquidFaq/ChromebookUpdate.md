# How do I make ChromeOS Updates cache?

ChromeOS updates are downloaded from Google over HTTP. Thus, they can be
cached on a standard Web caching server such as squid-cache. To make the
most of your caching server there are some configuration options that
you can optimize to improve the chances of successful caching your
ChromeOS updates. Examples are provided using Squid version 3.5, and
experienced IT administrators can adapt these settings to their choice
of proxy cache software.

  - **[maximum\_object\_size](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/maximum_object_size#)**.
    This is the maximum individual file size that the proxy would cache.
    In most cases, the default setting is lower than the average size of
    updates. For example, it is set at 4MB in Squid. Chrome updates are
    downloaded as one file, so make sure that this parameter is set at
    1GB or higher. You can use the same size limit for setting your
    [range\_offset\_limit](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/range_offset_limit#)

  - **[cache\_dir](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_dir#)**.
    By default, squid caches objects in memory. Uncomment this to cache
    objects to disk, and allocate an appropriate disk space for your
    needs.

  - **[maximum\_object\_size\_in\_memory](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/maximum_object_size_in_memory#)**.
    Thus can be kept unchanged if Squid is using disk storage. If not,
    consider increasing this to 2GB or more.

\* If you choose to use ACLs, you can add ChromeOS updates to the acl
list, for example:

    acl chromeos dstdomain dl.google.com
    http_access allow chromeos localnet
