# Binary Packages for Squid

## Do you have pre-compiled binaries available?

The squid core team members do not have the resources to make
pre-compiled binaries available. Instead, we invest effort into making
the source code very portable and rely on others to provide such
packaging as needed.

## How do I install a binary for ...

Most operating system distributions provide packages in the formats
appropriate for direct install on those systems. Please thank them.

### [CentOS](/KnowledgeBase/CentOS)

Squid bundles with CentOS. However there is apparently no publicly
available information about where to find the packages or who is
bundling them. EPEL, DAG and RPMforge repositories appear to no longer
contain any files. Other sources imply that CentOS is an alias for RHEL
(we know otherwise). Although, yes, the RHEL packages should work on
CentOS.

**Maintainer:** unknown

**Bug Reporting:**
[](http://bugs.centos.org/search.php?category=squid&sortby=last_updated&hide_status_id=-2)

**Eliezer**: 25/Apr/2017 - I have tested CentOS 7 RPMs for squid 3.5.25
on a small scale and it seems to be stable enough for 200-300 users as a
forward proxy and basic features.

#### NgTech CentOS/Fedora Copr hosted Repository

[](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/elicro/Squid-Cache/)

#### Stable Repository Package (like epel-release)

To install run the command:

    yum install http://ngtech.co.il/repo/centos/7/squid-repo-1-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm -y

or

    rpm -i http://ngtech.co.il/repo/centos/7/squid-repo-1-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm

and then install squid using the command:

    yum install squid

#### Squid-4 release

  - **Maintainer:** Unofficial packages built by Eliezer Croitoru which
    can be used on CentOS 7.

  - **Current:** 4.1-5 based on the latest release.

The RPMs was separated into three files:

  - squid-VERSION.rpm

  - squid-helpers-VERSION.rpm

  - squid-debuginfo-VERSION.rpm

The core squid rpm will provide the basic squid forward, intercept and
tproxy modes while also allowing ssl-bump. The helpers package contains
all sorts of other helpers which are bundled with squid sources but are
not essential for a basic and simple proxy.

  - pinger is now disabled by default to allow a smooth startup on
    selinux enabled system.

  - src rpm files are at:
    [](http://www1.ngtech.co.il/repo/centos/7/beta/SRPMS/)

  - binary RPMs can be found in the architecture specific folders at
    [](http://www1.ngtech.co.il/repo/centos/7/beta/x86_64/)

#### Squid-3.5

  - **Maintainer:** Unofficial packages built by Eliezer Croitoru which
    can be used on CentOS 6 and 7

  - **Current:** 3.5.25-1 based on the latest release.

The RPMs was separated into three files:

  - squid-VERSION.rpm

#### Squid-3.4

  - **Maintainer:** Unofficial packages built by Eliezer Croitoru which
    can be used on CentOS 6

  - **Eliezer**: As of 3.4.0.2 I am releasing the squid RPMs for two CPU
    classes OS, i686 and x86\_64.

  - Since somewhere in the 3.4 tree there was a change in the way the
    squid was packaged by me:

The RPMs was separated into three files:

  - squid-VERSION.rpm

  - squid-helpers-VERSION.rpm

  - squid-debuginfo-VERSION.rpm

The core squid rpm will provides the basic squid forward, intercept and
tproxy modes while also allowing ssl-bump. The helpers package contains
all sorts of other helpers which are bundled with squid sources but are
not essential for a basic and simple proxy.

There are couple issues that needs to be fixed since there was some data
loss in the transition from my old server to another.

  - The init.d script, I am have been working on it in my spare time.

#### Squid-X custom package

Ensure that **/etc/apt/sources.list** to enable the Debian sources
repository.

    deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian sid main

Install Procedure for the base package and its dependencies:

``` 
 aptitude install squid
```

The Debian squid team use git to manage these packages creation. If the
latest code is not yet in the apt repository you can build your own
cutting-edge package as follows:

    # install build dependencies
    sudo apt-get -t sid build-dep squid
    sudo apt-get install git git-buildpackage
    
    # place a hold on future automated upgrades of the squid package
    sudo aptitude hold squid
    
    # fetch the Debian package repository managed by the Debian pkg-squid team
    git clone https://salsa.debian.org/squid-team/squid.git pkg-squid
    cd pkg-squid && git checkout master

Edit debian/rules file to add or remove any custom features you need to
change.

Edit the top entry of debian/changelog to a note about your change, and
set a local version identifier such as:

    squid (4.4-1~example1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium
    
     * Added feature X for use by example

Building the .deb files

    gbp buildpackage
    cd ..

  - ![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
    the gbp command may fail to sign the packages if you are not a
    Debian maintainer yourself. That is okay.

Install Procedure:

``` 
 sudo dpkg -i squid-common_*.deb squid_*.deb
```

The process will create several other \*.deb packages. These are
optional. If you have not changed anything specific to those tools you
can safely use their normal Debian packages instead.

#### [(see Debian)](/KnowledgeBase/Debian)

Many versions of Ubuntu and Debian are routinely build-tested and
unit-tested as part of our
[BuildFarm](/BuildFarm#)
and are known to compile OK.

  - ![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
    The Linux system layout differs markedly from the Squid defaults.
    The following ./configure options are needed to install Squid into
    the Debian / Ubuntu standard filesystem locations:

<!-- end list -->

    --prefix=/usr \
    --localstatedir=/var \
    --libexecdir=${prefix}/lib/squid \
    --datadir=${prefix}/share/squid \
    --sysconfdir=/etc/squid \
    --with-default-user=proxy \
    --with-logdir=/var/log/squid \
    --with-pidfile=/var/run/squid.pid

Plus, of course, any custom configuration options you may need.

  - ![{X}](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/icon-error.png)
    For Debian Jesse (8), Ubuntu Oneiric (11.10), or older **squid3**
    packages; the above *squid* labels should have a **3** appended.

  - ![{X}](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/icon-error.png)
    Remember these are only defaults. Altering squid.conf you can point
    the logs at the right path anyway without either the workaround or
    the patching.

As always, additional libraries may be required to support the features
you want to build. The default package dependencies can be installed
using:

    aptitude build-dep squid

This requires only that your sources.list contain the **deb-src**
repository to pull the source package information. Features which are
not supported by the distribution package will need investigation to
discover the dependency package and install it.

  - ![{i}](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/icon-info.png)
    The usual one requested is **libssl-dev** for SSL support.
    
      - ![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
        However, please note that
        [Squid-3.5](/Squid-3.5#)
        is not compatible with OpenSSL v1.1+. As of Debian Squeeze, or
        Ubuntu Zesty the **libssl1.0-dev** package must be used instead.
        This is resolved in the
        [Squid-4](/Squid-4#)
        packages.

##### Init Script

The init.d script is part of the official Debain/Ubuntu packaging. It
does not come with Squid directly. So you will need to download a copy
from
[](https://alioth.debian.org/plugins/scmgit/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=pkg-squid/pkg-squid3.git;a=blob_plain;f=debian/squid.rc)
to /etc/init.d/squid

#### Compile on A basic Ubuntu Server

@Eliezer

Squid can be built on a basic Ubuntu basic Server and it seems like an
enterprise OS to me. The only dependencies are "build-essential" and
"libltdl-dev" for squid to run as a forward proxy.

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libltdl-dev

For more then just forward proxy like ssl-bump or tproxy We need a bit
more testing.

Latest squid 3.3.8 builds and runs on ubuntu server 13.04.
