# Neighbor

In Squid, *neighbor* usually means the same thing as *peer*. A neighbor
cache is one that you have defined with the *cache\_peer* configuration
option. Neighbor refers to either a parent or a sibling.

In Harvest 1.4, neighbor referred to what Squid calls a sibling. That
is, Harvest had *parents* and *neighbors*. For backward compatability,
the term neighbor is still accepted in some Squid configuration options.
