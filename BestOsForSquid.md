# What is the Best OS for Squid?

This is an all-time favourite FAQ, bound to show up every now and then
Squid Users mailing-list.

Generally speaking, any modern Linux, Unix-like operating system will
offer similarly good performance. A technically sensible administrator
will choose the best tool for the job, which means whatever OS she is
most comfortable with.

Several Linux distributions, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Windows tend to be
common choices.

## Tuning for More

What matters the most to obtain the most out of any setup is to properly
tune a few parameters. In priority order:

  - amount of physical memory available
    
      - the more the better, squid performance will suffer badly if
        parts of it are swapped out of core memory

  - CPU speed and core count
    
      - few faster cores are better than many slow cores. SMP Squid can
        currently operate most efficiently with 4-8 fast cores
    
      - only the physical cores are useful, hyper-threaded "cores" can
        actually reduce performance given Squid's workloads and use
        patterns

  - Number of harddrives used for cache and their architecture
    
      - squid disk access patterns hit particularly hard RAID systems -
        especially RAID4/5. Since the data are not by definition
        valuable, it is recommended to run the cache\_dirs on JBOD
        ("just a bunch of disks", in other words NO RAID) (see
        [SquidFaq/RAID](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/action/show/BestOsForSquid/SquidFaq/RAID#))
    
      - of course the disk type matters: SSD performs better than HDD
        (but be mindful about lifecycle), 15kRPM is better than 5.4kRPM,
        etc.

  - noatime mount option
    
      - atime is just useless for cache data - squid does its own
        timestamping, mounting the filesystem with the noatime option
        just saves a whole lot of writes to the disks

  - amount of space used
    
      - always leave about 20% of free space on the filesystems
        containing your cache\_dirs: generally FS performance degrades
        dramatically if used space exceeds 80%

  - type of filesystem
    
      - only applies on OSes which offer multiple choices (except for a
        few really bad choices of FS). see below.

On systems with synchronous directory updates (Solaris, some BSD
versions)

  - mount option to enable asynchronous directory updates, or preferably
    a filesystem meta journal on a separate device taking the heat of
    directory updates.
